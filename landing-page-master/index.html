        Dedicated to Lord Ram, the Ram Mandir stands as a testament to unity, devotion, and cultural heritage. 
        Join us on this divine quest as we strive to build a symbol of faith that transcends generations 
      <br>  Rama was born to Kaushalya and Dasharatha in Ayodhya, the capital of the Kingdom of Kosala.  
      His siblings included Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna. He married Sita. Though born in a royal family,  <br>  Rama's life is described in the Hindu texts as one challenged by unexpected changes, 
      such as an    exile into impoverished and difficult circumstances, and challenges of ethical questions and moral dilemmas.
        <br> Of all his travails, the most notable is the kidnapping of Sita by demon-king Ravana, followed by the determined and 
       epic efforts of Rama and Lakshmana to gain her freedom and destroy the evil Ravana against great odds.</p>
